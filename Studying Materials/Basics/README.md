Here you can find links for video lessons for Programming Basics with different programming languages.
Go ahead and choose a language and an instance. 

*Important*: All courses are similar.
Going through just one course will help you to understand the basics.
In other words: just choose a programming language and click on random link.
Then start watching the videos and if you don't like something (like the way the lecturer explains the new stuff) just change the course instance by choosing some other link. 

*Enjoy :)*

*Additional*: If you don't like these courses at all, that's totally fine.
You can follow any other tutorial or book or whatever you like.
The only important thing is and the end to have good understanding of the following topics:
* Simple Operations and Calculations
    * Variables and data types
    * Read data from the console
    * Simple operations (like reading numbers, reading text etc.)
    * Print data to the console
* Conditional Statements
    * Comparison operators
    * Simple conditional statements
    * Sequence of conditional statements
    * Nested conditional statements
    * Logical operators (like logical AND, logical OR, logical NOT)
* Loops
    * Incrementing and decrementing
    * 'While' loop
    * 'For' loop
    * Endless loops
    * 'break' and 'continue'
* Additional:
    * ASCII table
    * Life of a variable
    * Format output to the console
    * Simple string operations (I mean really simple: get the length of a string, get ASCII value of a character, make all characters uppercase or lowercase)
