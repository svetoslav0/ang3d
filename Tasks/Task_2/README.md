Your task is to create a register form and to handle it: take the data from the form and save it in a database.
A user must have the following attributes:
 - Username
 - Password
 - Confirm Password
 - Email
 - First Name
 - Last Name

No validations are required at this point.

After that you need to create a table (in the same page) that displays list of all users' data (except the password).
